In order to install this application, you will need Node.js on your local computer and have this repo cloned. Once you have that installed properly, you will need to open a terminal - either through VSCode or GitBash and input the command "node index.js". This will trigger a series of user prompts that you will need to complete. Once done, there will be a generated HTML file that you can view with the employee information.
